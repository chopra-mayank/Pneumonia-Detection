# 🫁 Pneumonia Detection Using Chest X-Ray Images

This project leverages deep learning to detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images. It features a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), a Flask web app for real-time predictions, and visualizations to track model performance.

---

## 🚀 Features

* ✅ CNN model trained on chest X-ray images
* 🌐 Flask-based web interface for predictions
* 📈 Visualizations of training accuracy and loss
* 🧩 Modular Python scripts for training, testing, and evaluation

## 🧠 Dataset

Dataset used: **Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia)** from Kaggle
🔗 [Kaggle Dataset Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia)

> ⚠️ Note: The dataset (`chest_xray/`) must be downloaded manually from the link above.

---

## 💻 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/chopra-mayank/Pneumonia-Detection.git
cd Pneumonia-Detection
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Run the web application

```bash
python app.py
```

### 4. Open in your browser

Visit [http://127.0.0.1:5000/](http://127.0.0.1:5000/) to access the application.

## 📌 Notes

* The trained model file (`our_model.h5`) is **not included** in the repository.
* You can either train the model yourself using the dataset or download a pre-trained version.
* Flask is used to serve the model and handle the front-end interface for local predictions.
